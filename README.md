# Routing Project: Basic Setup üöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Welcome to the Routing Project Basic Setup! This project will guide you through the fundamentals of routing in Angular. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Getting Started

## Install Dependencies: 
Run npm i to download the necessary dependencies, including node_modules and other files.

## Run Development Server: 
Launch the development server by running ng serve -o (or ng s --o). Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

## Covered Topics
Throughout this project, you will explore various aspects of routing in Angular. Here's a summary of what you'll learn:

01 - Route Configuration: Setting up routes for different components in Angular.

02 - Route Parameters: Passing parameters to routes for dynamic content.

03 - Route Guards: Implementing guards to control access to routes based on certain conditions.

04 - Nested Routes: Creating nested routes for more complex navigation structures.

05 - Lazy Loading: Loading modules and components lazily to improve application performance.

06 - Route Navigation: Navigating between routes programmatically using the Router service.

07 - Route Resolvers: Using resolvers to fetch data before activating a route.

08 - Route Events: Listening to route events and performing actions based on them.

09 - Route Redirects: Redirecting users to specific routes based on certain conditions.

By working through this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of routing in Angular and be well-equipped to implement navigation and routing features in your own applications.
